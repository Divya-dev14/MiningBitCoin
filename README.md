Project Description :

Project Requirements

Input : 
The input provided (as command line to yourproject1.fsx) will be, the required number of 0’s of the bitcoin.

Output : 
Print, on independent entry lines, the input string, and the corresponding SHA256 hash separated by a TAB, for each of the bitcoins you find. Obviously, your SHA256 hash must have the required number of leading 0s (k= 3 means3 0’s in the hash notation). An extra requirement, to ensure every group finds different coins, is to have the input string prefixed by the gator link ID of one of the team members.
